# About
Code repository for the Simon's Rock/College Textbook Service

# Hosting the site locally
Before you can run the server, make sure the dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
To run the server simply execute `node`

If this is successful, open up a browser and view the site at <code>localhost:8085/index.html</code>

If an error is thrown, `npm` either needs to be installed or the version is incorrect.
