				<i class="quote">"After I read a book called Blockchain Revolution last summer, I learned that peer-to-peer networking and
					decentralization would make a big influence on the current trade system. In addition, I read a book called
					Ecological Crisis, which makes me realize the deteriorating situation our environment is going through. Then,
					one day in the community council, several student representatives said that many of their friends strongly
					complaining about the present textbook trading market. Books are way too expensive. In addition, sometimes,
					after students buy the books in advance, some teachers change their initial plan and don’t need the books that
					students have already bought anymore. In this circumstance, students directly waste their money and can’t
					get any compensations back from the books they bought. What’s more, most of the time, students use the
					textbooks for only one semester and then threw it away. These books don’t get recycled and are often burned
					with other trash. Last but not least, textbooks are very expensive in America. It costs 267 dollars to buy
					a physics book and 122 dollars to buy a calculus book. Students can buy the same books at a much cheaper price.

					To solve these problems. We established Qu-swap, which aims for helping students trade their second-hand textbooks
					with each other at a much lower price. We want to help students reduce their financial burden and extend the
					lifetime of paper books." ~ Mark Ma
