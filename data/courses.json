What can we really know about an ultimately irretrievable past, how do we know it, and why? What is the relationship between the past,  as we scrutinize and reconstruct it from the perspective of the present, and life today, as well as, perhaps, life in the future? Is it possible to find meaning for ourselves,  and perhaps discover our identities, in the past, and if so, how? Are their particular scales of space and time that are best suited for history, and if so, what are they? Is  history a humanistic enterprise, meant to be narrated as stories, or a scientific way to test ideas from philosophy, the social sciences, and other disciplines according to  temporal variables?

In addition, we consider the peculiarly Islamic philosophical treatments of  classic problems in metaphysics: the nature of the soul and its relation to the body, the eternity of the world, and the nature of causality. There is also some discussion of  the development of both religious and philosophical mysticism in Islam (especially Sufism).
